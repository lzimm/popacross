-- this is fairly old school work yo --

here was the deal. i wanted to do this really simple project, that would
basically let you create these "really beautiful" pages with one single
purpose: to have an overwhelmingly beautiful call to action that you just
couldn't help but engage in it (ie: "buy now" or "share" or "sell mother").

all you would have to do is upload a few images, write a bit of text, decide
what you wanted said call to action to be (along with specifying all the
necessaries), and it would slap together a beautiful landing page with a 
shortlink that you could spam all over your social network. and yeah, this 
is when the idea was still "in the air", and gumroad, checkthis, and all
those other things were still also "just being born in secrecy" too.

but, thanks to being all up on using my magically unbattled server framework
(nothing like NIH syndrome to kill a good project), i ended up getting
distracted and did other things instead (actually, that's a lie, the backend
if not unnecessarily complicated for what it was, went together easilly and 
without much of an issue at all, i just couldn't stop redesigning the thing,
cuz, you know, story of my life).

anyways, standard disclaimer:

there's a bunch of extra junk in here you probably don't need to run it,
while on the other hand, its probably missing some stuff you do
(as well as any explanation of how all this junk works,
license information that i probably stripped from a bunch of files
and any sort of sanity). so funny.
